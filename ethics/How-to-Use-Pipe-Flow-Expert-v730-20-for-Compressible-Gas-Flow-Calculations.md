One of the new features of Pipe Flow Expert v7.30 20 is the support for compressible gas flow calculations. This means that you can now model pipe systems that involve gases that change their density and volume due to pressure and temperature changes. This is important for applications such as natural gas pipelines, air compressors, pneumatic systems, and more.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use Pipe Flow Expert v7.30 20 for compressible gas flow calculations. We will cover the following topics:
  
- How to select the gas type and properties
- How to enter the pipe system data and components
- How to choose the gas flow equation and calculation method
- How to view and interpret the results
- How to generate PDF reports and export data

## How to Select the Gas Type and Properties
  
The first step in using Pipe Flow Expert v7.30 20 for compressible gas flow calculations is to select the gas type and properties. You can do this by clicking on the Gas Data button on the toolbar or by selecting Gas Data from the Data menu.
  
This will open the Gas Data dialog box where you can choose from a list of predefined gases or enter your own custom gas data. The predefined gases include common gases such as air, ammonia, argon, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, oxygen, propane, etc. You can also use the Gas Properties Calculator to find the properties of any gas over a range of temperatures and pressures.
  
The gas properties that you need to enter or select are:

- The gas name
- The molecular weight
- The specific heat ratio
- The compressibility factor (Z)
- The ideal gas density
- The real gas density

You can also enter the standard volume units for the gas flow such as SCFM (standard cubic feet per minute), SCMH (standard cubic meters per hour), etc.
  
## How to Enter the Pipe System Data and Components
  
The next step in using Pipe Flow Expert v7.30 20 for compressible gas flow calculations is to enter the pipe system data and components. You can do this by using the drawing tools on the toolbar or by selecting Add Pipe from the Data menu.
  
You can draw pipes by clicking on a node and dragging to another node. You can also add nodes by double-clicking on an empty space on the drawing area. You can edit the properties of each pipe by double-clicking on it or by selecting Edit Pipe from the Data menu.
  
The pipe properties that you need to enter or select are:

- The pipe name
- The pipe length
- The pipe diameter
- The pipe roughness
- The pipe elevation change
- The pipe fittings (such as elbows, tees, reducers, etc.)

You can also add components such as pumps, valves, tanks, compressors, etc. by using the component tools on the toolbar or by selecting Add Component from the Data menu. You can edit the properties of each component by double-clicking on it or by selecting Edit Component from the Data menu.
  
The component properties that you need to enter or select depend on the type of component. For example, for a pump you need to enter or select:

- The pump name
- The pump curve data (flow rate vs head)
- The pump efficiency
- The pump speed
- The pump power consumption

For a valve you need to enter or select:

- The valve name
- The 0f148eb4a0
